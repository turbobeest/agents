## Summary Statistics

- **Fully Rewritten**: 4 files (data-engineer, data-scientist, database-admin, database-optimizer)
- **Cleaned Up**: 2 files (neo4j-expert, sql-pro - removed bloat)
- **Streamlined**: 1 file (ml-engineer - removed pipeline integration bloat)
- **Already Compliant**: 9 files (required no changes)

## Template Compliance

All 16 files now conform to the expert template structure:

### Frontmatter ✅
- Proper tier classification (expert)
- Tool modes defined (audit, solution, research, default_mode)
- Cognitive modes with mindset/output for all 4 modes
- Ensemble roles with behavioral descriptions
- Escalation triggers and thresholds
- Version numbers updated where changed

### Instructions ✅
- 15-20 instructions maximum (achieved: 17-18 avg)
- Structured by mode (Always, Generative, Critical, Evaluative, Informative)
- Domain-specific, actionable behaviors
- No generic advice

### Content ✅
- Identity with interpretive lens (bolded)
- Vocabulary section
- Never section (4-6 anti-patterns)
- 3+ Specializations with deep knowledge
- Knowledge Sources section
- Output Format with envelope

## Key Improvements

1. **Removed Dev-System Pipeline Bloat**: Eliminated OpenSpec, TaskMaster, human gates, phase gate references from agents that don't need them
2. **Streamlined Instructions**: Focused on core competencies, removed generic operational context
3. **Bolded Interpretive Lens**: Made the mental model clear and prominent in Identity sections
4. **Consistent Structure**: All agents now follow exact template format
5. **Version Tracking**: Updated versions to reflect changes

## Next Steps

This batch is complete and ready for dev-system pipeline integration. All 16 agents are now:
- Template compliant
- Focused on their domain expertise
- Free of unnecessary operational bloat
- Ready for production use
