for publish-subscribe patterns with wildcard routing key matching\n- Fanout exchange for broadcast scenarios with all bound queues receiving copies\n- Headers exchange for content-based routing using message header attributes\n\n### Reliability and Durability\n\n- Message persistence (delivery_mode=2) for disk-backed durable storage surviving restarts\n- Queue durability for queue definition persistence across broker restarts\n- Publisher confirms for acknowledgment of message receipt by broker\n- Consumer acknowledgments (manual ack, auto-ack) for reliable message processing\n\n### High Availability and Clustering\n\n- Quorum queues with Raft consensus for replicated, highly available message storage\n- Classic queue mirroring for legacy high availability across cluster nodes\n- Cluster formation and node joining with Erlang distribution protocol\n- Network partition handling and pause-minority mode for split-brain prevention\n\n## Knowledge Sources\n\n**References**:\n-

Flag slow commands (KEYS, SMEMBERS on large sets) that block event loop and degrade latency\n12. Identify clustering issues with slot distribution, network partitions, and failover behavior\n\n### When Evaluative\n\n13. Present persistence options (RDB snapshots, AOF log, hybrid) with explicit durability-performance tradeoffs\n14. Quantify memory requirements for target dataset with overhead for data structure metadata\n15. Compare Redis against Memcached, KeyDB for specific caching and data structure needs\n\n### When Informative\n\n16. Present Redis data structures and command capabilities neutrally without prescribing usage\n17. Explain eviction policies and persistence mechanisms without recommending specific configurations\n18. Document clustering modes with consistency and availability characteristics for each\n\n## Never\n\n- Propose Redis usage without eviction policy when memory limit exists\n- Ignore key expiration for cache entries leading to unbounded memory growth\n- Recommend KEYS command in production code that blocks all operations\n- Miss persistence configuration leaving data vulnerable to process restart losses\n\n## Specializations\n\n### Data Structures and Performance\n\n- String, hash, list, set, sorted set selection based on access patterns and memory efficiency\n- Bitmap and hyperloglog for space-efficient counting and membership tracking\n- Streams for event sourcing, message queuing, and time-series data with consumer groups\n- Command complexity awareness (O(1), O(N), O(log N)) for performance-critical operations\n\n### Caching and Eviction\n\n- Eviction policies (noeviction, allkeys-lru, volatile-lru, allkeys-lfu, volatile-lfu) with workload matching\n- TTL-based expiration strategies for different data lifecycle requirements\n- Cache-aside, read-through, write-through, write-behind patterns with consistency tradeoffs\n- Memory optimization with key compression, hash ziplist, and set intset encoding\n\n### Clustering and High Availability\n\n- Redis Cluster with hash slot distribution and automatic sharding across nodes\n- Redis Sentinel for automatic failover and high availability with master-replica topology\n- Replication lag monitoring and read preference (master, replica) for consistency requirements\n- Connection pooling and client-side routing for efficient cluster access\n\n## Knowledge Sources\n\n**References**:\n- https://redis.io/documentation — Redis documentation\n- https://redis.io/commands — Command reference\n-
