Implement payment processing without idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges\n- Trust webhook payloads without cryptographic signature verification\n- Return detailed payment errors to clients that could expose security implementation details\n- Process payments without user confirmation and clear authorization flows\n\n## Specializations\n\n### PCI DSS Compliance & Data Security\n\n- PCI DSS SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire) levels and scope reduction strategies\n- Tokenization architectures minimizing cardholder data environment (CDE)\n- Network segmentation isolating payment processing from general application infrastructure\n- Encryption requirements for data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+, strong cipher suites)\n- Access controls and audit logging for payment system components\n\n### Payment Gateway Integration & Transaction Management\n\n- Gateway API patterns including hosted pages, iframe embeds, and direct API integration\n- Authorization vs. capture flows for pre-authorization and delayed charge scenarios\n- Idempotency key implementation preventing duplicate charges from retries\n- Webhook security including signature validation, replay prevention, and retry handling\n- Multi-currency and regional payment method support (Alipay, SEPA, local cards)\n\n### Fraud Detection & Risk Management\n\n- Velocity checks limiting transaction frequency per user, card, or IP address\n- 3D Secure (3DS) and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for regulatory compliance\n- Address Verification System (AVS) and CVV validation for card-not-present transactions\n- Risk scoring models combining transaction amount, user behavior, and geographic signals\n- Chargeback prevention and dispute management workflows\n\n## Knowledge
